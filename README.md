## About This Project

This repository moves beyond simple match results to explore the underlying dynamics that shape professional football. By analyzing historical data from the Brazilian Championship (BrasileirÃ£o) and the FIFA World Cup, this project tests common hypotheses and builds predictive models to uncover actionable insights.

The central analyses aim to answer four key questions:
1.  Can **historical performance** accurately predict the top contenders in a league season?
2.  How significant is the **home-field advantage** in professional football?
3.  Does the **time of day** a match is played have any real impact on goal-scoring?
4.  Is modern football truly becoming **more defensive** over time?

## Analyses and Key Findings

Each question was investigated using a dedicated data analysis notebook. Here are the main findings:

### 1. Predicting the Brazilian Championship Top 5
> Can we use a team's track record to forecast its success in an upcoming season?

-   **Methodology:** A **Logistic Regression** model was trained on data from 2003-2018. The features consisted of a team's history of finishing in the Top 5 in the preceding years.
-   **ðŸ’¡ Key Finding:** The model achieved an impressive **97.7% accuracy** in predicting the Top 5 for the 2019 season. This confirms that past performance is an overwhelmingly strong predictor of future success, highlighting the consistent dominance of a few elite teams in the league.

### 2. The Power of Home-Field Advantage
> Is the "home advantage" a real, quantifiable phenomenon?

-   **Methodology:** A statistical analysis of match results from the Brazilian league was performed, comparing goals scored and matches won by home vs. away teams.
-   **ðŸ’¡ Key Finding:** The data shows a powerful home-field advantage. Home teams won **4,001 matches** compared to just **1,901** for away teams and scored over **50% more goals on average** (1.55 for home teams vs. 1.02 for away teams).

### 3. The Influence of Match Timing
> Does the kickoff time affect player performance and the number of goals scored?

-   **Methodology:** World Cup match data was cleaned and grouped by start time. A regression analysis and Pearson correlation were used to measure the relationship between match time and total goals.
-   **ðŸ’¡ Key Finding:** The analysis revealed a **near-zero correlation (0.004)**, indicating no statistically significant link between the time of day a match is played and the number of goals scored.

### 4. Goal Scoring Trends in the World Cup
> Has football become more offensive or defensive over time?

-   **Methodology:** An OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression was performed on the total goals per match for every World Cup year.
-   **ðŸ’¡ Key Finding:** The regression model showed a **statistically significant negative coefficient** for the `Year` variable. This suggests that, on average, the number of goals scored per match has slightly decreased over the history of the World Cup, lending data-driven support to the idea that modern football has become more strategically defensive.

## Tech Stack

-   **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
-   **Statistical Modeling:** `Scikit-learn`, `Statsmodels`, `SciPy`
-   **Data Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
-   **Environment:** `Jupyter / Google Colab Notebooks`

## Getting Started

To explore these analyses yourself, simply clone the repository and run the notebooks in an environment with the required libraries installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Gronoxx/Brazilian-League-Forecast.git](https://github.com/Gronoxx/Brazilian-League-Forecast.git)

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Brazilian-League-Forecast
```
From there, you can open and run any of the `.ipynb` files.
